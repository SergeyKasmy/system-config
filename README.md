# system-config
My personal set of scripts to ease up setting up a new system and sync the settings between them.
Beware that the repo is still WIP, especially the readme file.

### Plasma + i3
The splash screen should be disabled in `systemsettings5`

Everything else required for the integration of Plasma with i3 is in the plasma stow directory and 
the i3 config after the `## Plasma fix` tag
